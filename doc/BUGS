Winbond W83792D: +5V Vcc is incorrect
=======================================
Currently, boards which use the Winbond W83792D H/W monitoring IC will
have their +5V voltage shown incorrectly.

I've mailed Supermicro to try and find out why the calculation formula
is wrong (since what I'm following comes from Winbond), but as of this
writing have received no response.

I have also looked at the Linux lm-sensors project, but the code is
quite "spaghetti" -- it's hard to discern what the calculation values
are, and if they're the same for all W83792D systems.


Winbond W83792D: FAN3 RPMs may be inaccurate/high
===================================================
I've received a single (isolated) report involving a Supermicro P8SCi
board reporting absurdly high values for FAN3.  Example:

FAN1                        0 RPM
FAN2                     2909 RPM
FAN3                    84375 RPM
FAN4                        0 RPM
FAN5                        0 RPM

Further executions of bsdhwmon did not exhibit this problem.  However,
I take the report seriously, as it could indicate a strange bug in
bsdhwmon, or possibly a bug in the Winbond W83792D chipset.  At this
time I have not been able to determine the root cause, however the
user had his fan RPM configuration in the system BIOS set to
"3-pin Server" rather than "Disabled" (which runs the fans at full
speed).  This could be a bug in the Winbond chipset, but I simply
don't know.
