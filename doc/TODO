Never-ending
==============
- Add support for more motherboards as users request such.  :-)


Long-term TODO
================
- Extend structs to support custom mathematics operations; for
  example, some boards might calculate +5V differently than others,
  depending upon the value of the resistor tied to that pin.
- Replace the gigantic database of motherboards and output params with
  a text file, so that users can modify and change the output strings
  to whever they wish.  This would also decrease the program/binary
  size.
- Get in contact with Tyan regarding the Thunder LE-T (S2518), which
  appears to use the Winbond W83782D, and see if they'll provide SMBus
  documentation (if it supports tie-ins).
