	Attempt to support FreeBSD 11.x after smbcmd struct overhaul; see
	comments in smbus_io.c for details.

	Change Makefile CFLAGS and debugging decisions a bit; let's build
	with -Wall -Werror and friends by default.

	Fix typos and formatting mistakes in doc/BOARDS.

	Fix some groff/mdoc errors in bsdhwmon.8.

	Fix previous timestamp in doc/CHANGES (20141231, not 20151231).

	Fix 16-bit fan RPM overflow scenario (mainly for W83793G).

20141231
	Migrate to github.com instead of my own local CVS repository.

20140811
	Documentation/CHANGES typos/fixes.

20140625
	For read_byte() and write_byte(), renamed "index" variable to
	"idxreg" to avoid potential shadowing conflicts.

20130605
	Added -J flag to provide JSON-formatted output.

	Change post-increment (ex. i++) to pre-increment (ex. ++i).

	Remove some unused function prototype declarations, and declare a
	few functions as static.

	Shortened lines in some documentation.

	Clean up error handling code in main, make SMB I/O routines
	exit with EX_IOERR rather than 1.

	Use -Werror -Wall for non-debug builds, and use -Wformat-security
	for both build types.

20120702
	Some general documentation adjustments; nothing important.

	Adjust some CFLAGS (remove -Wunused; implied by -Wall).

	Split collect.c up into individual chip_XXX.c files; easier to
	maintain.

	W83627DHG: Add support for the Nuvoton/Winbond 83627DHG-P
	and 83627DHG-PT.

	Properly fix SMBus slave address addressing "bug" in 20090703.
	smb(4) and ichsmb(4) changes made shortly after the release of
	7.2-RELEASE (specifically __FreeBSD_version 702101) caused this.
	Key off of __FreeBSD_version to decide whether or not to shift
	the slave address or not.  Thanks to Billy Newsom for bringing
	this to my attention.

	W83792D: Fetch Winbond chip revision for debugging purposes.

	Use exclusive locks when opening the /dev/smbX device; this ensures
	only one bsdhwmon process can access the device at a time.

	Fixes for small memory leaks (missing free() statements), re-order
	some include statements, and pre-initialise some structs.  Valgrind
	came in handy here for sure!

	Try our best to adhere to style(9).  This includes:
	- Making use of err(3) family functions and sysexits(3) codes
	- General code formatting changes

	Ensure consistency of variable sizes between x86 and amd64; make
	use of intXX_t and uintXX_t types.  This also falls under style(9).

	Addition of doc/REFERENCES (technical reference material).

	Update author Email address (yes, again).

	Make better use of "const" throughout program, especially for the
	pinmap structs.

	Update all source code headers' copyright years.

20090703
	Fix SMBus slave address addressing bug.  SMBus slave addresses
	are actually shifted to the left 1 bit (e.g. 0x2f becomes 0x5e),
	so that the LSB is always 0.  As of 2009/05/15, a commit was made
	to RELENG_7 to ensure that the LSB is always 0; bsdhwmon would
	return invalid results if run on a RELENG_7 kernel built after
	that date.  See commit 1.38.2.1 here:
	http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/sys/dev/smbus/smb.c

	Add code for handling error condition where ioctl() returns -1;
	bail out entirely when this happens, displaying errno too.

	Update author Email address.

20081107
	Extend SMBIOS checking; previously we used smbios.planar.model,
	now we use both smbios.planar.maker AND smbios.planar.model.  This
	adds extra granularity in the case two different motherboard manu-
	facturers share the same "maker" string.

	Change from MAXPATHLEN to KENV_MVALLEN for kenv(2) strings, since
	that appears to be the true maximum length.

	Change function prototypes to include variable names; easier
	cross-referencing when others look at the source.

	New board: Supermicro X7SBA.

20081005
	Initial public release.
