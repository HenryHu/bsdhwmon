Description
=============
bsdhwmon(8) is a program for FreeBSD for monitoring hardware sensors
(fans, temperatures, voltages, chassis intrusion, and more) on
commerical-grade server hardware. bsdhwmon(8) is developed with a very
different mentality compared to other softwares: 

- Written with stability and production environments in mind
- Intended for use with server products (Intel, Supermicro, Tyan, and
  possibly others)
- Solely uses smb(4), significantly decreasing risks and CPU usage
- Based primarily on documentation provided by motherboard/server
  vendors and H/W monitoring IC manufacturers
- Full tested on both i386 and amd64 systems, using RELENG_6,
  RELENG_7, RELENG_8, and RELENG_9
- Written entirely in C
- Completely standalone; relies on no third-party libraries or tools
  (autoconf, etc.)
- Very simple and clean code -- heavily commented, well-documented,
  developed and built with -Wall -Werror, and similar ideals
- Open-source, released under the FreeBSD 2-clause BSD license
